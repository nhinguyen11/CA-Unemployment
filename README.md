# Unemployment in California 

This is my final project for STAT 3080 (From Data to Knowledge). It explores whether unemployment rates of California counties are influenced by high or low white populations. This project uses R as its main programming language.

Please refer to the "Project-Part-5.pdf" file for data descriptions, graphs, analyses, and references.
Please refer to the "Project-Part-5.Rmd" file for the project code and the "Project Data.xlsx" file for the data set.
