# Unemployment in California 

This is my final project for STAT 3080 (From Data to Knowledge). It explores whether unemployment rates of Californian counties are influenced by high or low white populations.

Please refer to the "Project-Part-5.pdf" file for data descriptions, graphs, analyses, and references.
Please refer to the "Project-Part-5.Rmd" file for the project code and the "Project Data.xlsx" file for the data set.
